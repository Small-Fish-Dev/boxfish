---

#### About

The library should work straight out the box without any crazy setup.
You should aim to use the `VoxelVolume` or `NetworkedVoxelVolume` components, if those don't fulfil your needs, look at implementing your own `BaseVoxelVolume<T, U>`.

#### Issues

If you encounter issues with the library, please open an issue, or a pull request to fix said issue.

In your issue (or pull request) describe the problem, and the steps for reproducing said problem.
